**First Project**

This is a client/server system implemented in C# using the .NET framework libraries (System*). The purpose of this system is to provide a file coverage processing service for CSV files. It allows clients to send multiple files to the server for processing, according to the defined rules.

**Features**

- Client/Server Architecture: The system follows a client/server model, where the client program communicates with the server program to send files for processing and receive the results.
- CSV File Processing: The server is capable of processing CSV files, extracting coverage data, and performing calculations or analysis based on the provided rules.
- Protocol Specification: A custom communication protocol is defined for the interaction between the client and server. This protocol outlines the message formats, commands, and responses used for file submission, processing, and result retrieval.
- Scalability: The system is designed to handle multiple file submissions concurrently, allowing efficient processing of a large number of files.
- Error Handling: The system includes robust error handling mechanisms to ensure that errors during file processing or communication are properly handled and reported to the client.

**Usage**
1. Start the server program on a designated machine or network.
2. Run the client program on a client machine.
3. Establish a connection between the client and server using the specified network configuration.
4. Select the CSV files to be processed and submit them to the server for processing.
5. Monitor the progress of file processing and receive the results from the server.
6. Analyze and utilize the processed coverage data as required by the client application.

**Note**

This system is developed as a sample project to demonstrate client/server communication and CSV file processing using C# and .NET framework libraries. It can serve as a foundation for building more complex coverage processing systems or be customized to meet specific requirements.

**Second Project**

Telecommunication operators have a defined coverage for their fixed network services, which includes the geographical area they operate in and the technology used (FTTH, HFC, ADSL, etc.). One of the ways they can expand their coverage is through contracts with other operators. They establish agreements where they share information about the households that have coverage and where they can provide services.

**Project Description**

This project aims to develop a system that enables telecommunication operators to share their fixed network coverage information with each other. The system will facilitate the exchange of data between operators, allowing them to identify the households where coverage is available and where they can offer their services. The system will be implemented using C# and the .NET framework libraries, leveraging the capabilities of the platform for efficient data sharing and processing.

**Key Features**
- Coverage Data Sharing: The system will enable operators to share information about the households that have coverage in their respective networks. This data will include the address, technology type, and other relevant details.
- Secure Data Exchange: The system will implement secure mechanisms for data exchange between operators, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the shared information.
- File and Service-based Sharing: Operators will have the flexibility to share coverage information through various means, such as file exchange or web services.
- Compatibility and Integration: The system will support compatibility with different formats and standards used by telecommunication operators, ensuring seamless integration into their existing infrastructure.
- User-Friendly Interface: The system will provide a user-friendly interface for operators to manage the sharing process, including uploading and downloading coverage files, monitoring sharing agreements, and resolving any discrepancies.

**Benefits**

- Enhanced Coverage Expansion: The system will facilitate collaboration between operators, allowing them to extend their coverage more efficiently and reach a larger customer base.
- Operational Efficiency: By streamlining the sharing process, operators can save time and resources typically required for manual data exchange and verification.
- Improved Customer Experience: The system enables operators to provide better services to customers by expanding coverage and offering a wider range of options.
- Business Opportunities: Operators can explore new business opportunities through partnerships and collaborations, leveraging shared coverage information for strategic decision-making.
